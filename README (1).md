Microsoft: Classifying Cybersecurity Incidents with Machine Learning

****Project Overview
****
This =project aims to enhance the efficiency of Security Operation Centers (SOCs) by developing a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the triage grade of cybersecurity incidents. Using the comprehensive GUIDE dataset, the model categorizes incidents as true positive (TP), benign positive (BP), or false positive (FP) based on historical evidence and customer responses. The ultimate goal is to support guided response systems in providing SOC analysts with precise, context-rich recommendations, thereby improving the overall security posture of enterprise environments.

Cybersecurity Concepts and Frameworks 
Handling Imbalanced Datasets
Model Benchmarking and Optimization

****Data Preprocessing Steps:
****Handling missing values Feature engineering (e.g., timestamp transformation) Encoding categorical variables Normalization/Standardization of numerical features Approach

1. Data Exploration
Inspect the dataset (train.csv) for feature types and distributions. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify correlations and class imbalances.

2. Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values using imputation or removal. Engineer new features to enhance model performance. Encode categorical features (One-Hot, Label Encoding, etc.). Normalize/standardize numerical features for better model performance.

3. Data Splitting
Split the data into training and validation sets (e.g., 80-20 split). Use stratification to preserve the distribution of the target variable across both sets.

4. Model Selection and Training
Begin with a baseline model (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree). Train advanced models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM), and Neural Networks. Implement cross-validation to ensure consistent model performance.

5. Model Evaluation
Use macro-F1 score, precision, and recall to assess model performance. Tune hyperparameters using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search. Address class imbalance with methods like SMOTE or class weighting.

6. Model Interpretation
Analyze feature importance using SHAP values or permutation importance. Conduct error analysis to understand and minimize misclassifications.

7. Final Evaluation on Test Set
Evaluate the final model on the test.csv dataset and report performance metrics (macro-F1, precision, recall). Compare results with baseline performance to ensure model improvement.

**Results**

By the end of this project, the goal is to:

Develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the triage grade of cybersecurity incidents (TP, BP, FP) with a high macro-F1 score, precision, and recall.
Provide a comprehensive analysis of model performance, highlighting influential features.
Produce detailed documentation of the model development process, including potential deployment strategies.
